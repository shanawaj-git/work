# Note
This is extracted from the npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-business-time which has import issue of 'moment' within it when we use in the application. Adding a minor fix in `lib/business-hours.js` to make it working.
This shall be revisited and reverted to use the actual npm package.
